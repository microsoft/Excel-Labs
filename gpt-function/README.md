# GPT function, an Excel Labs feature

GPT function creates a custom function called LABS.GPT that you can use to send prompts from the Excel grid to OpenAIâ€™s GPT language model. LABS.GPT returns the results from GPT back to your worksheet.

You can send GPT simple or complex prompts to analyze information, import public data, produce a response based on a sample, and more. LABS.GPT allows you to reference other cells in your workbook, and it can be called inside any Excel cell or named formula in the workbook.

The GPT function also includes model settings, which let you to choose from six different GPT models, control the default output length of results returned from GPT, and more.

## Examples

The following examples show several ways to use LABS.GPT.

- Analyze public information. Ask GPT to parse the tweets from a particular account, such as:

    ```
    =LABS.GPT("What is the most common word in tweets from Microsoft?")
    ```

- Import data and define the format. Ask GPT to import a particular type of publicly available data, and tell GPT how to format the information, such as:

    ```
    =LABS.GPT("Return the airport codes for 2 airports. Return this as a comma-separated list in the format of: Full airport name, Country, Airport code")
    ```

- Answer a factual question. Reference other cells in this workbook to formulate the prompt:

    ```
    // Enter "France" in cell A1. In another cell, enter:
    =LABS.GPT("What is the capital city of: " &A1)
    ```

For more examples, see [GPT function samples](EXAMPLES.md).

## Requirements

The GPT function uses the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) technology from OpenAI. To use the LABS.GPT function, you must register an OpenAI account and generate a unique API key.
